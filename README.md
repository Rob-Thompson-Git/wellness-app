# AWAKEN, a wellness application

## 
Awaken is designed to help users focus on their mental and physical wellness as they go through their days. Our goal was to create an application that would allow the user to fill in information about their general wellness habits: sleep, mood, water intake, and exercise. This application was build with JavaScript, Node js,Handlebars, Express, UIKit CSS, APIs, and MySql. <br>

This was a week-long project built at the end of the second month of Northwestern Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This is a collaborative full-stack application. <br>
