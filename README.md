# AWAKEN, a wellness application

## 
Awaken is designed to help users focus on their mental and physical wellness as they go through their days. Our goal was to create an application that would allow the user to fill in information about their general wellness habits: sleep, mood, water intake, and exercise. This application was build with JavaScript, Node js,Handlebars, Express, UIKit CSS, APIs, and MySql. <br>

This was a week-long project built at the end of the second month of Northwestern Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This is a collaborative full-stack application. <br>

## Usage
When the application is deployed you will begin on the landing page. Should you decide to create an account, you may use the following test user options to login: <br>

username: test123 <br>
email: test123@test.com <br>
password: test123123 <br>

username: test987 <br>
email: test987@test.com <br>
password: test987987 <br>

username: test456 <br>
email: test456@test.com <br>
password: test456456 <br>

Alternatively, users are welcome to use their preferred test logins - we just ask that your password contain 10 characters. <br>
Users will need to run "npm i" and install/login to Mysql and drop the database before starting. <br>
